# MEDICAL IMAGE SYNTHESIS FOR AUGMENTED DIAGNOSIS
Problem Statement:
In medical image analysis, the availability of large, diverse datasets is crucial for training accurate deep learning models. However, due to factors such as patient privacy concerns, data scarcity, and the high cost of acquiring labeled medical images, many healthcare institutions and research labs have limited access to adequately sized datasets. This shortage of data poses a significant challenge in training robust and generalizable models for tasks like disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction using medical imaging modalities such as MRI and CT scans.

To address this challenge, there is a need to develop a system that can generate synthetic medical images realistically. These synthetic images should closely resemble real patient scans in terms of anatomical structures, textures, and imaging characteristics while also covering a wide range of variations that occur in clinical practice. By generating synthetic medical images, this system aims to augment limited datasets, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of deep learning models for medical image analysis tasks and ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care outcomes.
